# Otter
A discord bot that generates pictures of otters.

> **Note:** This bot isn't meant to be self-hosted, the source code is just here for people to help work on it, therefore there will be no support given on how to set it up.

## Contributing
Otter's code is open-sourced to allow the anyone to contribute to its development, and feel free to do so by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/ArhanCodes/Otter/compare). However, I expect a clear description of what your pull request is about and what feature it adds/what problem it solves.

### Credits
[Sean](https://github.com/devramsean0) @ [Otter Bots](https://github.com/Otter-Bots): Contributing to development.
